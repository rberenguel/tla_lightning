# Formally Verifying __Complex Systems__ Using $$TLA^+$$

Lightning talk I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at Scala Exchange on December 2018 to give a quick overview of TLA+ and PlusCal and how they can be used to model systems we use as Scala developers.

You can find the slides here ??? or here ???. I recommend you check the version with presenter notes ???. You can watch the live recording here ???

Sadly the PDF does not show animated gifs or videos, you can either check what they are in the images folder ??? or watch the video.

This presentation is formatted in Markdown and prepared to be used with
[Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/). The drawings were done on an iPad Pro
using [Procreate](https://procreate.art). **Here only the final PDF and the
source Markdown is available **. Sadly animated gifs and video are just static images in the PDF.
