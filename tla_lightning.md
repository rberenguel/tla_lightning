# [fit] Formal methods
# [fit] __Why?__

---

![](images/Example1.png)

^ I had a system based in Akka

---

![](images/Example2.png)

^ Requiring to communicate with many external systems (via TCP)

---

![](images/Example3.png)

^ The system was using Akka persistence to store its internal state mutations

---

![](images/Example4.png)

^ An external "source" (say, a user) would trigger a change request that would need to be forwarded to the external systems when they were available. The state of the request goes into the internal state of the actor.

---

![](images/Example5.png)

^ And they should answer fulfilment status of the request when possible. How can I be sure the external services get the request, and the actor system get the confirmation, given the large amount of possible states that persistence introduces?

# What are _formal methods_?

[.build-lists: true]

- __Technique__ for specifying the behaviour of hardware or software
- Based on some __mathematical formalism__ or __theory__

---

# Examples

[.build-lists: true]

- Lambda calculus
- (possibly dependent) Type systems
- TLA (_T_emporal _L_ogic of _A_ctions)

---

[.build-lists: true]

## What does formal verification require?

- Write a __specification__ of what the system is supposed to do
- Computationally verify the __desired properties__
- Optionally/Additionally: __Prove__ the desired properties of the system

^A specification is an abstraction: it describes some aspects of the system and
ignores others. We want the specification to be as simple as possible (but, like
someone famous said, _not simpler_)

---

[.build-lists: true]

## What is $$TLA^+$$?

---

### Formal specification language developed on top of __TLA__ by Leslie Lamport[^1]

#### Models written in $$TLA^+$$ can be checked using __TLC__

[^1]: The _La_ from $$\LaTeX$$ and the, well, author of the [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) consensus algorithm, among many other things

^ _Temporal Logic_ was introduced in the late 1950s, and LLs Temporal Logic of Actions was published in 1994. The $$TLA^+$$ language was introduced in 1999, late that year TLC was started

--- 

### A pseudocode-like language, __PlusCal__ transpiles into $$TLA^+$$, and can be used for sequential algorithms
 
#### Comes in two flavours, __P__[^2] and __C__[^3]

[^2]: P of _Pascal_? `begin while do stuff end while;`

[^3]: C as in _C_, {curly curly}

^ PlusCal (formerly +Cal) has been available since 2009

---

### An additional proof system __TLAPS__[^4] can be used to check proofs

#### This is how __Bizantyne Paxos__[^5] was proven, and has been used in several industry projects

[^4]: Can be found [here](http://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html), it's separate from the TLA+ Toolbox

[^5]: [Mechanically Checked Safety Proof of a Byzantine Paxos Algorithm](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/byzpaxos.html)

^ Has been used for proving soundness in Azure's CosmosDB, for instance

---

 __System__ | __Components__ | __Lines of Code__ | __Result__
------ | ---------- | :---: | ------
_S3_ | _Fault tolerant network algo_ | _804 (PlusCal)_ | _2 bugs, further bugs in later optimisations_
S3 | Background redistribution | 645 (PlusCal) | 1 bug, 1 bug in the fix
_DynamoDB_ | _Replication & membership_ | _939 (PlusCal)_ | _3 bugs (35 step trace)_
EBS | Volume management | 223 (PlusCal) | Better confidence
_Internal lock manager_ | _Replication_ | _318 TLA+_ | _1 bug_

^ Here we can see some examples of use from Amazon Web Services (from [here](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf))

---

## How does $$TLA^+$$ look like?

^ I will show a simple infinite state machine in TLA+

### We can "easily" model whole systems using __PlusCal__ 
#### Likeâ€¦

---

```scala
case class Trigger(payload: Payload)

class SimpleActor extends Actor {
  def receive = {
    case Trigger(payload) => ThirdParty().trigger(payload)
    case _                => log.warn("Duh")
  }
}
```

^Here we have a very, very simple actor that on receiving a `Trigger` message, will ping a third party with the paylod.

---

### With __PlusCal__ we can model concurrent (or not) systems by using `process`

^ Although $$TLA^+$$ can express more models than PlusCal can, it's way easier to define sequential processes running possibly in parallel in PlusCal

---

```
variables actorInboxes = [ actor |-> <<>> ];
          triggered = FALSE;

procedure trigger(trigger_content="?") {
    triggerLabel:
      triggered := TRUE;
      return;
}

fair process (actor = "actor")
variables currentMessage = <<"?", "no_content">>;
  kind = "?";
  content = "no_content";
{
  Send:
    actorInboxes["actor"] := Append(actorInboxes["actor"], <<"trigger", "foo">>);
  WaitForMessages:+
    while (TRUE) {
      if (actorInboxes["actor"] /= <<>>) {
         currentMessage := Head(actorInboxes["actor"]);               
         content := Head(Tail(currentMessage));
         kind := Head(currentMessage);
         actorInboxes["actor"] := Tail(actorInboxes["actor"]);
        };
        ProcessMessage:
         if (kind = "trigger") {
           call trigger(content);
         }
    }
}
```

^ This is how an actor system roughly equivalent to the previous actor would look like. I'll break it up in the next slides

---

[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 1-2]

```
variables actorInboxes = [ actor |-> <<>> ];
          triggered = FALSE;

procedure trigger(trigger_content="?") {
    triggerLabel:
      triggered := TRUE;
      return;
}
```

^ This just sets up some inbox system, ignores the fact that the third party provider may fail receiving the request and sets the scene for checking some property

---

[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 1]
[.code-highlight: 10-15]
[.code-highlight: 16-19]
[.code-highlight: all]

```
fair process (actor = "actor")
variables currentMessage = <<"?", "no_content">>;
  kind = "?";
  content = "no_content";
{
  Send:
    actorInboxes["actor"] := Append(actorInboxes["actor"], <<"trigger", "foo">>);
  WaitForMessages:+
    while (TRUE) {
      if (actorInboxes["actor"] /= <<>>) {
         currentMessage := Head(actorInboxes["actor"]);               
         content := Head(Tail(currentMessage));
         kind := Head(currentMessage);
         actorInboxes["actor"] := Tail(actorInboxes["actor"]);
        };
        ProcessMessage:
         if (kind = "trigger") {
           call trigger(content);
         }
    }
}
```

^ This is a possible approach of what the actor might look like. It starts by seeding the inbox with a trigger (you can alternatively add a different process to do so, but this is better when you don't care about the source). Then it calls the trigger process if it _receive_s a trigger message

---

A possible check on this system could then be

```
Triggered == triggered = TRUE

Liveness == <>Triggered
```

^ We could for instance check that eventually the third party system is triggered. This is what I did in my problem in the beginning: Do the action happen on the remote server, and the confirmation eventually makes it into the actor system? In a space of around 14 thousand states, the answer was yes.
